        <p>This project focused on designing a story-driven 2D board game that highlights key visual communication principles. The game was later adapted into a partial 3D format, incorporating foundational Product and Industrial Design concepts. By using shapes, colors, and imagery, the gameplay experience was enhanced, immersing players in the narrative and demonstrating the power of thoughtful design in both 2D and 3D formats.</p>
